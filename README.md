Classification of message received by users
Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy. This project aims to build a spam classifier for SMS received by the mobile phone users.
We will building the application from scratch and will follow the traditional Data science workflow.
The project is written in R markdown format.
